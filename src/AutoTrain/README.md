# AutoTrain

The AutoTrain package is a powerful Python module designed to streamline the machine learning model training process.
It automates the monitoring of model performance, initiates retraining when performance decreases, and selects datasets
intelligently using state-of-the-art STT (Speech-to-Text) models.

## Features
### 1. Automatic Model Performance Detection
AutoTrain includes an intelligent mechanism to continuously monitor your model's performance. It evaluates the model's
confidence in its predictions and detects performance decreases. When the confidence falls below a certain threshold,
AutoTrain triggers the retraining process.

### 2. Automatic Model Re-Train
When the model's performance declines, AutoTrain automatically initiates the retraining process. This feature ensures
that your machine learning model remains up-to-date and performs optimally.

### 3. Automatically Select Datasets
AutoTrain makes dataset selection easier by leveraging STT models. These models can transcribe speech into text,
allowing you to choose datasets based on the content and context of the spoken language.
This dynamic dataset selection enhances your model's adaptability to specific domains or languages.
